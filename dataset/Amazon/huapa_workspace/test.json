The steam was a bit of trouble. The more they move these game to steam the more of a hard time I have activating and playing a game. But in spite of that it was fun, I liked it.

Boy was I wrong! From the moment I finally got the gamed Fired up (the other commentors on this are right, it takes forever and u are forced to create an account) I watched as it booted up I could tell right off the bat that ALOT of thought went into making this game. If you have ever played Sim city, then this game is a must try as you will easily navigate thru it and its multi layers. I have been playing htis now for a month straight, and I am STILL discovering layers of complexity in the game. There are a few things in the game that could used tweaked, but all in all this is a 5 star game.", "summary": "A very good game balance of skill with depth of choices", "unixReviewTime": 1393804800}
